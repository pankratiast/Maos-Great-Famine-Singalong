## Prompts for animating CPC Posters & Historical Photography
You can view the prompts used for each animated clip in the file name. Additionally, you can infer the model used to animate the picture in its title as well--though, of course, the LumaLabs clips live in the [Luma animated irl pics] and [Luma Animated Posters] folders whereas files living in [Runway ML Videos] used Runway ML models 

## Note
Many files are redundant, and while I did my best to organize each in as legible a format as possible, it was difficult to clean and order folders after creative process took place. Prompts and model used are included in title of video/image name.

We must never permit the pestilence of communism to infect our minds and spirits.
