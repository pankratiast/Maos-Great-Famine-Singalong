## Great Leap Fwd. Quick Facts:

Stats and numbers from Perplexity:
- 30 - 45 million deaths (Dikkiter)
- 30 - 40% of housing stock was demolished to obtain raw materials for collective projects (investopedia)
- Official Records stated 1,289 cases of cannibalism in 1960 (Radio free Asia, RFA)
- About 30m births were lost or postponed (China’s great famine - 40 years later)


## Excerpts from Frank Dikkiter, Mao's Great Famine:
““Between 1958 and 1962, China descended into hell. Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, threw his country into a frenzy with the Great Leap Forward”
[…]
““the peasant masses were mobilised to transform both agriculture and industry at the same time, converting a backward economy into a modern communist society of plenty for all. In the pursuit of a utopian paradise, everything was collectivised, as villagers were herded together in giant communes which heralded the advent of communism. People in the countryside were robbed of their work, their homes, their land, their belongings and their livelihood. Food, distributed by the spoonful in collective canteens according to merit, became a weapon to force people to follow the party’s every dictate. 

“Irrigation campaigns forced up to half the villagers to work for weeks on end on giant water-conservancy projects, often far from home, without adequate food and rest. The experiment ended in the greatest catastrophe the country had ever known, destroying tens of millions of lives.”

“Hunger drove the starving to forage for seeds, grasses, leaves, and tree bark, and when even these became scarce, they boiled leather or ate soil just to fill their stomachs, even when it destroyed their digestive tracts. Given the prevalence of hunger and exposed corpses, some inevitably turned to cannibalism. Although this involved scavenging for the most part, occasionally persons—usually children—were intentionally killed as food.” - Asian Studies

## Timeline Below from Mao's Great Famine: The History of China's Most Devastating Catastrophe, 1985-1962

Autumn 1955–spring 1956:
Mao, displeased with the slow pace of economic development, pushes for the accelerated collectivisation of the countryside and for huge increases in the production of grain, cotton, coal and steel. His ‘Socialist High Tide’, also referred to by some historians as the ‘Little Leap Forward’, produces industrial shortages and famine in parts of the countryside.

Summer 1957:
The campaign backfires as a mounting barrage of criticism questions the very right of the party to rule. Mao turns around and accuses these critical voices of being ‘bad elements’ bent on destroying the party. He puts Deng Xiaoping in charge of an anti-rightist campaign, which persecutes half a million people – many of them students and intellectuals deported to remote areas to do hard labour. The party finds unity behind its Chairman.

November 1957:
Mao visits Moscow. Impressed by the Soviet sputnik, the first satellite launched into orbit, he declares that the ‘East wind prevails over the west wind.’ In response to Khrushchev’s announcement that the Soviet Union will outstrip the United States in economic production in fifteen years, he declares that China will overtake Britain in the same period.

Winter 1957–spring 1958:
In a series of party conferences Mao attacks Zhou Enlai and other senior leaders who opposed his economic policy. He promotes his own vision of mass mobilisation and accelerated collectivisation of the countryside, demanding increased agricultural and industrial targets. The slogan ‘going all out, aiming high, and achieving more, faster and more economical results’ becomes the party line.

Winter 1957–summer 1958:
A campaign of repression targets hundreds of thousands of party members critical of economic policy. Several provincial party leaders are purged and replaced by close followers of Mao. Opposition from within the party is silenced.

Winter 1957–spring 1958:
A massive water-conservancy campaign is launched, marking the start of the ‘Great Leap Forward’ for hundreds of millions of ordinary villagers compelled to work for weeks on end on remote projects, often without sufficient rest and food.

Summer 1958:
The mass mobilisation of villagers around huge water projects requires much larger administrative units in the countryside

November 1958 - 1959
[Mao] tries to rein in some of the worst abuses of the Great Leap Forward, but continues to push forward with collectivisation.

March 1959 
[Mao] presses for even higher procurement targets in the countryside, up to a third of all grain, despite widespread famine.

Summer 1959 - Summer 1960
Tens of millions of villagers die of starvation, disease or torture.

## English translation of 'Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China' lyrics:

Without the Communist Party, there would be no new China
Without the Communist Party, there would be no new China
The Communist Party has toiled for the nation
The Communist Party of one mind saved China
It pointed to the road of liberation for the people
It has led China towards the light
It supported the War of Resistance for more than eight years
it improved the people’s lives
it built bases behind enemy lines
it practised democracy and brought many benefits
Without the Communist Party, there would be no new China
Without the Communist Party, there would be no new China
Without the Communist Party, there would be no new China
Without the Communist Party, there would be no new China
